        <h3 class="title">Special effects production</h3>
        <p>In film and television, artificial creation of illusion and illusion is called special effects (also known as special effects).Filmmakers use them to avoid putting actors in a dangerous situation, to reduce the cost of making movies, or simply to use them to make movies more compelling.</p>
        <h4>Miniature model:</h4>
        <p>Models of people, monsters, buildings and vehicles are used to make special effects.When the model must be moved, we can move them in either of three ways: by hand, by machine, or by electricity.It takes a long time to move them by hand, because the model requires at least 24 actions on the screen for a second.</p>
        <p>As one of the indispensable elements in the film industry, special effects have made great contributions to the development of films. Why special effects exist in film and television works?</p>
        <p>The content of film and television works and the life/scene in the film are completely fictitious, and there are no real ones, such as monsters, and certain planets.Since it doesn't exist, it needs to be present in film and television, so the professionals in this field need to create and solve it.</p>
        <p>Reality can exist, but it's impossible to make a particular effect, and it also requires special effects,For example, if someone jumps from the 30th floor, it's impossible for an actor to do that, which requires a computer to synthesize.In addition, the reality can be completely presented, but because the cost is too high or the effect is bad, special effects must be used to solve it. Such as the plane explosion in the war movies.</p>

        <h4>CG special effects</h4>
        <p>3d effects. Most of the roles and scenes of stereoscopic change are created by 3d effects.3d effects are almost the most difficult, but also the most effective, part of the problem.For example, the various realistic monsters in the film, the floods that flooded the city in 2012, the collapse of the skyscrapers, etc.The general production process is: model - material lighting - binding - animation - rendering.</p>

        <h4>compound special effects</h4>
        <p>The most common use of synthetic effects is that the great man in the costume is flying around in the sky.Specific implementation methods:Actors fight from the sky, in which actors fight part by actors hanging wire in the blue screen or green screen shot, and then in the computer using the software will be blue screen and later steel wire, optical part actors on scene shooting again left front of the sky.It looks like the actors are fighting in the sky.Of course, concrete composition is much more complicated than this, and many of the later software can also make partial effects of 3d effects, but only as an assistant, it is unlikely to replace 3d software.</p>

        <h4>Digital painting and conceptual design</h4>
        <p>Digital picture:For example a panoramic view of ancient city appear in the film, involving thousands of ancient dwellings or palace flowers and plants trees, Bridges and so on, if require 3 d software do it, the cost will be very big, often need many people cooperate to complete, but with the digital paint film division, he alone can be painted a picture all these.</p>
        <p>Conceptual design:Conceptual design is usually used for pre-production reference.Let's say there's a monster in the movie, but what does the monster look like?The director USES the language to say, the concept stylist draws in the form of the picture according to the director, determines the image, then gives the 3d special effects to make the lifelike variety of monsters.</p>

        <h4>Function:</h4>
        <p>In the current film production process, from the beginning of the shooting script, the special effects have been reflected, and the effects of the film and TV have changed the process and way of the original film production.Scenario planning, the arrangement of the narrative, the film and television special effects to the creator jumped out of the traditional linear thinking mode, completely broke the concept of space and time, so some limited to take appearance technology can be realized, the creator of the hands and feet, and give full play to the imagination. In addition to traditional scripts and shooting scripts, special effects are needed for special effects.</p>
        <p>In the early shooting, in addition to the field shooting, the scene, the blue screen, the model, digital skylight paintings and more.In order to meet the demands of the keyer, actor was asked in the blue screen studio photography, because the blue screen relative, no scenario, all by actors, also requires performing emotional action consistent with synthetic images of the scene, this is without a doubt for the actor's experience and performing skills of a challenge.</p>
        <p>And the requirements for lighting and props are different from traditional shooting requirements:Light workers want to combine to synthesis of background light, environment changes including the wind and rain lightning, design studio lighting, some parts of the props will be hidden in a blue cloth, also need in production and to synthetic items together seamlessly.The requirement for landscape and prop personnel is not just to do some kind of physical model, but to draw the necessary scenes and props in the computer for later synthesis.</p>
        <p>After the completion of the previous work, after the synthesis process, the computer technology was completely used, and the traditional special effects methods, such as the original mask and the folding shadow, were replaced by some functions of computer software.</p>
