        <h3 class="title">360 holographic</h3>
        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>360 holography, which we call 360 degree hologram here.360 hologram also known as 3 d hologram, holographic three-dimensional imaging, it is made of transparent materials all around the cone, the line of sight of the audience can penetrate it from any side, through the surface reflection principle, the audience can see from the cone-shaped space free floating images and graphics.The four sides video images reflect the light signals into the special prism in the cone, and together they form stereoscopic images with real dimensional space.</p>
        <h4>Brief introduction:</h4>
        <p>Holographic imaging is 360 degrees in the world in recent years the rise of a new type of display technology, this technology can make the stereo images without any screen or medium and directly suspended in free space, outside the equipment and 360 Â° arbitrary Angle is 3 d image display, the show means breaking the conventional physical show means stereo images of sharpness and color return true degree is high, stereo sense is strong, therefore very lifelike, can give audience to novel, the mysterious visual impact, inspire the audience to explore the desire, and can rise to gather the sentiment, deepen the impression visitors, raise public awareness is displayed.</p>
        <h4>Principle:</h4>
        <p>The 360-degree holographic phantom imaging system is a semi aerial imaging system that suspends three-dimensional images in the body of a cabinet.360 holographic phantom imaging system consists of cabinet put oneself in another's position, beam splitter, video broadcast equipment, based on spectroscopic imaging principle, through special processing of the product will build a three-dimensional model, and then 3 d model of product image or product image stack into the scene, make up the product display system for static combination.Without the need for people to wear any polarizing glasses, you can enjoy 3D phantom stereo display effects without any restraint, and give people a visual impact with a strong sense of depth.</p>
        <h4>Scope of application:</h4>
        <p>360-degree holography is a kind of mid-air imaging that suspends 3d images in real time. It creates an illusion and real atmosphere. It has a strange effect and has a strong sense of depth.The combination of image and object can be realized in the form of aerial illusion.It can also be equipped with a touch screen to interact with the audience.You can make a four-sided window according to your requirements, with a maximum of 2-4 meters per face.Can be made a holographic phantom stage, the product three-dimensional 360-degree demonstration;Real and unreal people perform together;The dream stage of the science museum.It is also applicable to display and release of various products.For example, the exhibition and release of famous watches, famous cars, jewelry and industrial products.</p>
