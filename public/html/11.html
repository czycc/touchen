            <p>3 d building projection 3 d projection, also called metope 3 d light show, the huge projection, 3 dmapping, is specific building facade as a giant projection screen, combined with the building unique appearance design, 3 d animation film, through professional large screen fusion calibration system will be a special images projected on the building surface, combining building shadow, so as to achieve and strengthen extremely realistic 3 d effect.The viewer can enjoy the stunning 3D sensory enjoyment without wearing any external equipment, thus achieving excellent publicity results.</p>

            <p>Building a 3 d projection is developed in recent years a new kind of digital technology, the biggest difference is that he and the traditional projection before our main carrier of projection is indoor screen is given priority to, but the building projection projection vector is the construction of the outdoor, is can't compare with the scale on the vision;</p>

            </div>
            <p>Secondly, in the content of the projection screen, we're not going to literally put a movie in the building, building is the core of the 3 d projection through the projection, make digital animation image and building can organic unifies in together, in simple terms is to make the building became a part of the picture, let the animation "interaction" with the building, that's the key to building projection wonderful.</p>
