        <h3 class="title">The phantom imaging</h3>
        <p> the phantom imaging system is based on "live model" and "the phantom" optical imaging, the images will be (people and things) projected on the scenery in the box body model in the landscape, demonstrate the development of the story.Vivid, unreal, very intuitive, usually give a deep impression.By the three-dimensional model scene, modeling lights system, optical imaging system, film and television broadcast system, computer multimedia system, sound system and control system, can realize the big scene, complex production lines, vivid display of large products, etc.</p>

        <h4>Viewing size:</h4>
        <p>The phantom imaging system is usually designed with a single scene or four scenes, and can enjoy the width of the frame by 1.0m to 10m.Scene height 2 meters -- 2.5 meters;Scene depth 2.0 meters -- 3.0 meters;The image height is 0.4 meter - 1.80 meters.</p>

        <h4>Design features:</h4>
        <p>Using "imaging depth control technology", the deep space of the phantom image can be realized, so that the image and background scenes are perfectly integrated.</p>
        <p>It also has the following advantages: the height of the characters can be 50 centimeters -- 180 centimeters (according to the user needs to adjust the height of the image);The character picture is clear, the skin color is restored correctly, the silk hair is clearly visible;The gray level is continuous, the visual layer is good, the stereo feeling is strong;No jagged edge, no flicker, soft nature;Background props can be at the mercy of the real space position, make the various visual elements in the real environment in accordance with the real space position relations perspective, visual content rich, the scene of the stereo sense is strong.The background light effect can be arbitrary set, the picture layer feels and the depth is strong.</p>
